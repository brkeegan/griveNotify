The griveLogNotify script is a wrapper for grive. The script checks if grive is currently running and checks for a web connection on startup.
If successful, the script will notify the user when sync has started and will notify when Finished.
This is achieved by checking the log file.
Currebntly the log file is passed in as command line arg.
